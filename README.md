4.4. Align all content to the center of the screen<br>
4.5. After pressing the "Login" button (if the correct data is entered - transfer to the HomeScreen)
(For convenience, implement a small array of users with login and password fields and validate the login according to this data)<br>
5. Functionality of the second screen:<br>
5.1. In the header on the right, make a Log Out button, after clicking on which - the user is transferred back to the LoginScreen.<br>
5.2. When mounting the screen, execute a request to receive posts (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)<br>
5.3. While the request is being executed, display the loading indicator in the center of the screen<br>
5.4. Record the received data in the state, and in case of an error, display the Snackbar (react-native-snackbar library) with the text "An error occurred" and the button "Repeat the request", tap on which to send the request posts again.<br>
5.5. For posts:<br>
5.5.1. Display FlatList on the entire screen with the output of the posts themselves (output title, body)<br>
5.5.2. By clicking on one post, open a modal window that should occupy no more than 50% of the entire screen and complete the comments request for this post (from the same resource).<br>
